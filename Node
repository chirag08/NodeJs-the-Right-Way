EventEmitter and Stream

event dispatching

Best Practices : “functions as first-class citizens” and block scoping.

In Node.js, a module is a self-contained bit of JavaScript that provides functionality to be used elsewhere

EventEmitter is a very important class in Node. It provides a channel for events
to be dispatched and listeners notified.

An event listener is a callback function that is
invoked when an event of a specified type is dispatched. Since the Stream class
inherits from EventEmitter , we can listen for events from the child process’s
standard output stream.

Data events in particular pass along a buffer
object

A Buffer is Node’s way of representing binary data. It points to a blob of
memory allocated by Node’s native core, outside of the JavaScript engine.
Buffers can’t be resized and they require encoding and decoding to convert
to and from JavaScript strings.
